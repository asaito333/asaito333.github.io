#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a PhD student at the [Center for Geospatial Analytics](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/) at North Carolina State University interested in applying machine learning and hydrology to coastal flood mitigation. I am in the [the Climate, Hydrology and Water Resources Modeling and Synthesis Group](https://ccee.ncsu.edu/chwr/). As one of the fellow of Global Change Research Fellow at [Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center](https://secasc.ncsu.edu/), I am committed to translating research into real-world solutions. 

My passion also lies in advancing women in STEM. I co-founded a nonprofit in Japan empowering young women in technology and continue to channel my energy to the area aside of my research career. Currently, I serve as a member at the Diversity and Inclusion Committee at [the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai-gakkai.or.jp/en/) to foster gender diversity in AI.
